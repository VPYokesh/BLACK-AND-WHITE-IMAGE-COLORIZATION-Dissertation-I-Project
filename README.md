# Black and White Image Colorization using GAN

## 📌 Project Overview
Color plays a vital role in visual perception, yet many historical photographs, archival media, and grayscale datasets lack chromatic information. Manual colorization is time-consuming and subjective, making it unsuitable for large-scale applications.

This project presents a **GAN-based automatic image colorization system** that converts grayscale images into realistic color images. The proposed approach uses a **U-Net based Generator** and a **PatchGAN Discriminator**, enhanced with multiple loss functions to ensure high-quality, visually consistent colorization.

## 🧠 Problem Statement
Grayscale images lack chromatic cues required for realistic interpretation of scenes. Traditional colorization approaches rely on manual intervention or rule-based techniques, which fail to generalize across diverse images. CNN-only models often generate dull or desaturated outputs.

The challenge lies in designing an automated system capable of learning semantic context, preserving structural details, and producing visually convincing colors while maintaining training stability.

## 🚀 Proposed Solution
A **GAN-based supervised image colorization framework** is developed with the following components:

- **Generator**: U-Net architecture with skip connections to preserve textures and edges
- **Discriminator**: PatchGAN that evaluates local image realism
- **Loss Functions**:
  - Adversarial Loss
  - L1 Reconstruction Loss
  - Perceptual Loss (VGG19)
  - Color-Constancy Loss

This multi-loss strategy ensures realistic, sharp, and color-balanced outputs.
